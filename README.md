# sonic-pi-drum-grid
A drumgrid made in p5.js that sends real time midi messages to sonic pi

This project creates a drumgrid using p5.js, tone.js and webMIDI to send midi messages to Sonic Pi.
The p5 sketch will include availible midi outputs as checkboxes. Select one to use before starting to play or else you will not hear anything. 

The Sonic Pi code can be found in the separate code file in this repository.
Make sure the midi message is the same as the midi output you select in the checkbox for the p5 sketch.
If you are not sure what midi outputs you have available, go to preferences in Sonic Pi, then I/O, and look under midi ports. There will be a list of available midi iputs and outputs.
